# heart-disease-prediction
Predict the likelihood of patients getting a heart attack using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. 
This project aims to identify heart diseases and initiate appropriate treatment to prevent complications. 
The system is implemented using Python and the KNN classification algorithm.

1.Features

- Predicts the likelihood of a patient getting a heart attack
- Utilizes the KNN classification algorithm
- Provides an efficient tool for early detection of heart diseases

2.Installation & Execution

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Heart-Disease-Prediction-System.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-System`
- Make sure you have Python installed (version X.Y) by running:
    python --version
- Install the required dependencies:
- Run the prediction system:
   HeartApp or HeartDiseasePredictionApp
- Input patient data when prompted (age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.).
- Receive the prediction of the likelihood of the patient getting a heart attack.
